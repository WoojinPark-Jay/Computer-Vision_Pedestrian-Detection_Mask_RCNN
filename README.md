# Mask_RCNN

Problem Statement

Autonomous vehicles need to identify human features accurately to ensure safe self-driving in real-time. When autonomous vehicles are able to identify human features or even yet, accurately classify the type of feature, it will be able to make better decisions quickly. But as the types of scenarios of transportation are diversified, we are increasingly in need of more sophisticated human detection techniques applying advanced ‘Instance segmentation’ deep learning techniques called Mask R-CNN.

Our Approach: Mask R-CNN (Computer Vision)

We apply a general framework for object ‘Instance Segmentation’ and the model we implement in this project is called ‘Mask R-CNN’. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. 
Instance segmentation is challenging because it requires the correct detection of all objects in an image while also precisely segmenting each instance. It, therefore, combines elements from the classical computer vision tasks of object detection, where the goal is to classify individual objects and localize each using a bounding box, and semantic segmentation, where the goal is to classify each pixel into a fixed set of categories without differentiating object instances.
